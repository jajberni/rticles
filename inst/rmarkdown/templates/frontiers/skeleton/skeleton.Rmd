# Introduction
For Original Research Articles [@conference], Clinical Trial Articles [@article],
and Technology Reports [@patent], the introduction should be succinct, with no subheadings [@book].
For Case Reports the Introduction should include symptoms at presentation [@chapter],
physical exams and lab results [@dataset].


# Article types

For requirements for a specific article type please refer to the Article Types
on any Frontiers journal page. Please also refer to  [Author Guidelines](http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#sections) for
further information on how to organize your manuscript in the required sections
or their equivalents for your field



<!-- Comments should be HTML-style comments

  For Original Research articles, please note that the Material and Methods
  section can be placed in any of the following ways: before Results,
  before Discussion or after Discussion.

-->

# Manuscript formatting

## Heading levels

## Level 2

### Level 3

#### Level 4

## Equations

Equations should be inserted in editable format from the equation editor.

An equation without a label for cross-referencing:

$$
E=mc^2
$$

An inline equation: $y=ax+b$

An equation with a label for cross-referencing:

\begin{equation}
\sum x+ y =Z\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

This equation can be referenced as follows: Eq. \ref{eq:eq1}

## Figures

Frontiers requires figures to be submitted individually, in the same order as
they are referred to in the manuscript. Figures will then be automatically
embedded at the bottom of the submitted manuscript. Kindly ensure that each
table and figure is mentioned in the text and in numerical order. Permission
must be obtained for use of copyrighted material from other sources (including
the web). Please note that it is compulsory to follow figure instructions.
Figures which are not according to the guidelines will cause substantial delay
during the production process.

Please see [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/guidelines/author-guidelines#figure-requirements-and-style-guidelines)
for full figure guidelines. Cite figures with figure \ref{fig:figure1} and figures \ref{fig:figure2}, \ref{fig:figure3}, and \ref{fig:sepal.width}.

This template doesn't support subfigures.

You can use `R` chunks directly to plot graphs.

```{r graph, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.show = "hide"}
x <- 0:100
set.seed(999)
y <- 2 * (x + rnorm(length(x), sd = 3) + 3)
plot(x, y)
```


### Permission to Reuse and Copyright

Figures, tables, and images will be published under a Creative Commons CC-BY licence and permission must be obtained for
use of copyrighted material from other sources (including re-published/adapted/modified/partial figures and images from
the internet). It is the responsibility of the authors to acquire the licenses, to follow any citation instructions
requested by third-party rights holders, and cover any supplementary charges.


## Tables

Tables should be inserted at the end of the manuscript. Please build your table directly in LaTeX.Tables provided as
jpeg/tiff files will not be accepted. Please note that very large tables (covering several pages) cannot be included
in the final PDF for reasons of space. These tables will be published as
[Supplementary Material](https://www.frontiersin.org/guidelines/author-guidelines#supplementary-material)
on the online article page at the time of acceptance. The author will be notified during the typesetting of the final
article if this is the case.


# Nomenclature

## Resource Identification Initiative

To take part in the Resource Identification Initiative, please use the corresponding catalog number and RRID in your
current manuscript. For more information about the project and for steps on how to search for an RRID, please click
[here](http://www.frontiersin.org/files/pdf/letter_to_author.pdf).


## Life Science Identifiers

Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) for ZOOBANK registered names or nomenclatural acts should be listed in the manuscript
before the keywords. For more information on LSIDs please see the [Nomenclature](https://www.frontiersin.org/guidelines/author-guidelines#nomenclature)
section of the guidelines.

# Additional Requirements

For additional requirements for specific article types and further information please refer to the individual Frontiers
journal pages


# Conflict-of-Interest Statement {-}

<!--
Frontiers follows the recommendations by the International Committee of Medical
Journal Editors (http://www.icmje.org/ethical_4conflicts.html) which require
that all financial, commercial or other relationships that might be perceived by
the academic community as representing a potential conflict of interest must be
disclosed. If no such relationship exists, authors will be asked to declare that
the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial
relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. When
disclosing the potential conflict of interest, the authors need to address the
following points:

 - Did you or your institution at any time receive payment or services from a
   third party for any aspect of the submitted work?
 - Please declare financial relationships with entities that could be perceived
   to influence, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, what
   you wrote in the submitted work.
 - Please declare patents and copyrights, whether pending, issued, licensed
   and/or receiving royalties relevant to the work.
 - Please state other relationships or activities that readers could perceive to
   have influenced, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, what
   you wrote in the submitted work.

If no such relationship exists, authors will be asked to confirm the following statement:
 -->

The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that
could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.


# Author Contributions {-}

<!--

When determining authorship the following criteria should be observed:

 - Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the
   acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
 - Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual
   content; AND
 - Final approval of the version to be published ; AND
 - Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that
   questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are
   appropriately investigated and resolved.

Contributors who meet fewer than all 4 of the above criteria for authorship
should not be listed as authors, but they should be acknowledged.
(http://www.icmje.org/roles_a.html)

-->

The statement about the authors and contributors can be up to several sentences
long, describing the tasks of individual authors referred to by their initials
and should be included at the end of the manuscript before the References
section.

# Funding {-}

Details of all funding sources should be provided, including grant numbers if applicable. Please ensure to add all
necessary funding information, as after publication this is no longer possible.


# Acknowledgments {-}

This is a short text to acknowledge the contributions of specific colleagues, institutions, or agencies that aided the
efforts of the authors.

# Supplemental Data {-}

[Supplementary Material](https://www.frontiersin.org/guidelines/author-guidelines#supplementary-material) should be
uploaded separately on submission, if there are Supplementary Figures, please include the caption in the same file as
the figure. LaTeX Supplementary Material templates can be found in the Frontiers LaTeX folder.


# Data Availability Statement {-}

The datasets [GENERATED/ANALYZED] for this study can be found in the [NAME OF REPOSITORY] [LINK].
